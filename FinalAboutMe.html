  <p><b>More About Me</b></p>
  <p>My name is S'ther Francis (Es-tuh frAHn-sis) and I am a 16-year old student from the
    island of Saint Lucia. I go by the pronouns she/her. I previously attended the Vieux-Fort
    Comprehensive Secondary School for 5 years and I am currently taking the 2-year Advanced
    Level course. I enjoy listening to k-pop music, learning k-pop dances, watching k-dramas
    and playing with my 3 dogs: Asia, Pity and Hulk <3.</p>

    <p>A few k-dramas I'd like to recommend include:
      <ul>
        <li>Stranger</li>
        <li>Hospital Playlist (seasons 1 and 2!)
        <li>Vincenzo</li>
        <li>Reply 1988</li>
        <li>Crash Landing On You</li>
        <li>The Rise of Phoenixes</li>
        <li>Mine</li>
      </ul>

      <p>I learned about Society of Women Coders through a close friend who participated
        in their previous online workshop. She spoke highly of the program and often displayed
        her ability to edit the codes of existing websites. She also heads the organisation's
        local chapter, SOWCoders SLU. I am glad to have taken part in this initiative
        alongside other girls and women and our ever helpful mentors.</p>
