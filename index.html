      <p> Hello.</p>
      <!--Talk about what you want to delve into-->
      <p>According to Cheryl Grant at VerywillMind, colourism is the practice of favouring lighter
        skin over darker skin and this preference can be seen within any racial or ethnic background.
        For people of African decent, it can be as blatant as being denied entry into a restuarant to
        as subtle as always being the 'background friend' in group pictures.</p>

      <p>Dark-skinned girls and boys grow to dislike or even resent the colour of their skin and are
        often socialised in a way that makes them feel inferior to their lighter counterparts. For
        example, whether intentional or subconscious, darker-skinned people tend to stand behind
        their lighter friends. Another example is how many black Caribbean men openly express that
        they could never love a dark-skinned woman because they do not want their children to be "just
        as loud and ghetto".</p>

      <p>I chose to create this website because I want little boys and girls who look like me to
        love their skin and grow to see it as their most valued feature, as I have had to learn
        myself. I want little black boys and girls to understand and believe that they should
        never be denied any opportunity, undermined or inferioriated or disrespected solely
        because of their darker colour. I do not intend to generate any profit other than a
        more afro-appreciative community and region.</p>

        <p> Below, is a news story covering the skin bleaching phenomena in Grenada, which is a
        result of the pressure on darker women to receive validation through lighter skin.</p>
